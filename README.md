# ðŸ§® STARK Proof Generator

**STARK Proof Generator** is a Python application that generates and verifies lightweight cryptographic proofs inspired by the STARK protocol.  
The service exposes a simple HTTP API using **Flask**, designed to run in serverless environments like **Google Cloud Run**.
